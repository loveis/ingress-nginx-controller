# Ingress NGINX Controller

> **⚠️ Maintenance Mode — Forkline Maintained Fork**
>
> This is a maintained fork of the retired Kubernetes ingress-nginx controller, kept in **strict maintenance mode**: no new features, no behavior changes — only dependency updates and security patches. We use date-based versioning (e.g., `v2026.5.3`) since semantic versioning has no meaning when there are no features or breaking changes.
>
> **For new deployments**, consider [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/) implementations instead. This fork serves existing ingress-nginx users who need continued maintenance.
>
> Maintained by [Forkline](https://github.com/forkline) using coding-agent orchestration — automated but never unattended.

* Best-effort maintenance continued until March 2026.
* Upstream no longer provides releases, bugfixes, or security updates.
* Existing deployments and historical artifacts remain important for operators and forks like this one.

## Overview

ingress-nginx was an Ingress controller for Kubernetes using [NGINX](https://www.nginx.org/) as a reverse proxy and load
balancer.

[Learn more about Ingress on the Kubernetes documentation site](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

## Usage warnings

Do not use in multi-tenant Kubernetes production installations. This project assumes that users that can create Ingress objects are administrators of the cluster. See the [FAQ](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/faq/#faq) for more.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, review the [troubleshooting docs](docs/troubleshooting.md),
[search for an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues), or talk to us on the
